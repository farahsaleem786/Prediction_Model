# Drug Response Prediction Application

This repository contains a Streamlit application for analyzing drug responses in cancer treatment using gene expression data. The application utilizes various machine learning models to predict drug effectiveness based on the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP) datasets.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Perform detailed analyses of CCLE and CTRP datasets. Interactive plots to visualize CCLE and CTRP datasets.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate multiple regression models and visualize their performance metrics.  Interactive plots to visualize actual vs. predicted values, residuals, and frequency distributions of genes and models used.
- **Prediction**: Predict drug responses using trained machine learning models based on user-uploaded gene expression data.
